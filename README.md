# PyCpp

An effort to bring Cpp like syntax to Python

## Documentation

WIP, but feel free to look at the [examples](https://github.com/WizzyGeek/PyCpp/tree/master/examples)

## Why?

It works, and who cares more.

## Contribution

You are welcome to contribute more Cpp like syntax or to dive into Python internals to make the syntax more accurate.
However, the actual library code should be pythonic.

## Installation

`python -m pip install Py.Cpp`
